## Salutations, as you will

I do try to keep things professional, but sometimes it’s alright to wander off into distant worlds—ideas and illusions that may turn into reality someday. Turning those into reality is a constant effort, but okay, I guess -?

Most of my work is centered around **cybersecurity** in general.  
That said, yes—I do wander out into distant worlds from time to time... :)

If you’re looking for something specific, you’ll likely find it in the **Repositories** section, so go ahead and start there.

Anyway, this was **Adwait Bhardwaj**  
*(aka. vt-abt)*

This GitHub account was originally used only by me as one of several personal accounts. Since then, due to a series of events, multiple accounts have been merged and organized into this single profile:

`/volantethakur`, `/vnr517`, `/cspectreman`, `/clipper-spectreman`, `/nevermind0102`, `/sceptre-ab`, and `/vnr517-b-side`

All projects hosted here may belong to individual efforts or teams of individuals.  
However, the profile itself is exclusively hosted on behalf of:

- **Adwait Bhardwaj** *(vt-abt)*  
- **Aishwarya Saha** *(vnr517)*

Any inconvenience caused by this consolidation is regretted.  
I hope to serve you well, if that is what it means. But anyway.
